# Runtime Error in Next.js 15 Client Component using fetch()

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications when using the `fetch` API within a client component. The error arises from attempting to use `fetch` directly in a client-side environment without proper error handling or checking for browser compatibility.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to fetch data from an external API using `fetch`.  This works fine in a browser environment, but it can lead to errors in Next.js's server-side rendering or during other stages of the application lifecycle if not handled correctly.  Simply calling fetch() within the component without proper async/await and error handling isn't best practice.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a solution that addresses the error by using async/await and handling potential errors during the fetching process.
